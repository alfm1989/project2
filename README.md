# project2

Project description: 

The aim of the project will  be to create an interactive website in which key aspects of the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 disease are represented. Among these, we think it useful to depict the rate of mortality by country, an aspect that is not present in pre-existing interactive databases. Also, we would include, the share of the population that has been diagnosed and other demongraphic attributes of the population (i.e., average age of the population)

We will be using data from a git hub repository on COVID-19 specifics (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), which we will combine with that obtained through the World Bank API. Together these datasets provide all the necessary information. We will pull the data through Flask and cleanse it using SQL. That would pave the way for us to build the interactive website/maps. 

For creating the interactive website/map we will rely on JS such as those seen in class (i.e., Mapout) plus other which we have spotted as being useful. We will also lean on Leaflet library to provide useful layers and attributes to the presentation of data that make it easier to understand. 

The aim is to create a go-to website where you can find useful and condensed information on the COVID-19 ongoing pandemic.
